{"subjective": "The patient reports a persistent cough lasting approximately two weeks, worsening at night and causing shortness of breath. The patient also experiences mild chest discomfort during intense coughing. There is no fever or chills; however, mild chest discomfort and wheezing are noted. The patient has a history of mild asthma, which is generally well-controlled with occasional use of an inhaler. Recently, the patient's daughter contracted a cold, leading to potential cross-infection.", "objective": "Physical examination reveals mild wheezing predominantly on the right lung. Oxygen saturation is within normal limits. No evidence of pneumonia or other respiratory distress is observed. The patient's appetite is acceptable, though they report feeling slightly fatigued.", "assessment": "The primary diagnosis is an asthma exacerbation likely triggered by a viral infection, considering the presence of wheezing and the recent exposure to a cold. Differential diagnoses could include bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although these are less likely given the acute nature and absence of typical COPD features such as increased sputum production.", "plan": "Prescribe a short course of oral steroids to manage inflammation and reduce airway hyperresponsiveness. Advise the patient to continue using their regular asthma inhaler regimen. Recommend increasing fluid intake and ensuring adequate rest. Monitor the patient closely for any deterioration in respiratory status or new symptoms. If symptoms persist or worsen despite treatment, immediate emergency room evaluation is recommended."}
