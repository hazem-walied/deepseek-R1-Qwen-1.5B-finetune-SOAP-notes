{"subjective": "The patient reports a persistent cough for two weeks, worsening at night and accompanied by shortness of breath. The patient has mild asthma, well-controlled, and uses an inhaler occasionally. There is a history of a cold from a previous illness, and the patient experiences wheezing, especially at night, and coughs up clear phlegm. The patient also reports feeling tired and having a history of chest pain.", "objective": "Vital signs are normal. No signs of pneumonia are present. The patient's respiratory symptoms include mild wheezing in both lungs, more pronounced on the right side.", "assessment": "The primary diagnosis is an asthma flare-up, likely triggered by a viral infection, with differential diagnoses including other respiratory conditions. The patient's asthma is controlled, but there is a risk of exacerbation. The presence of wheezing and phlegm suggests an underlying respiratory condition.", "plan": "Prescribe oral steroids to manage the asthma. Advise the patient to use the inhaler regularly for the next few days. Advise the patient to drink plenty of fluids and rest. If breathing worsens, the patient should be taken to the emergency room. Monitor respiratory status closely and adjust the treatment plan as necessary."}
